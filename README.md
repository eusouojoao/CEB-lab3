## Introduction
The objective of this laboratory work is to analyze the operation of the CMOS inverter circuit. The circuit consists of two complementary MOS transistors (NMOS - N-channel and PMOS - P-channel). Various characteristics of this inverter circuit will be considered, including its transfer characteristic, noise margins, and propagation delay times.

The CMOS inverter circuit will be implemented using the CD4007 integrated circuit, which contains six enhancement-mode MOS transistors, with three N-channel and three P-channel transistors.
